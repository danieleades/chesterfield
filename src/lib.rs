//! An ergonomic, strongly typed, asynchronous CouchDB client in Rust.
//!
//! [see the documentation](https://docs.rs/chesterfield/0.0.1/chesterfield/)
//!
//! *(note that the docs.rs documentation might be lagging behind master)*
//!
//! Couldn't find a decent, maintained CouchDB client in Rust. Also I wanted async. So i rolled my own.
//!
//! This is still in active development, in the sense that I add things when I need them, and fix bugs when they affect
//! me directly.
//!
//! Would be thrilled to have a couple more sets of eyes and keyboards chipping away at this. climb aboard.
